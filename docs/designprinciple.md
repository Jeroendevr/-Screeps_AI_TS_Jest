# Design Principles

## Strategic goals of this creep bot

- Survive as a species (read my own creeps)

## Sub goals

- Muliply
- Defend

## Multiply

The more creeps the smaller the chance of a single point of failure. This also the case for the amount of rooms. From this statement follows the need to increase GCL because it allows for more rooms

# Guiding principles

## Keywords

- Anarchism
- Bottom-up
- Imuun system alike (Drawn inspiration from the human imune system for more info see book Imuun from kurzgesagt )

The whishes and experience of every creep should be accounted. The system should handle these whishes and experiences so that it is manageable.

# Definitions

## System

As one of the keywords is anarchism, I try to avoid a structure where every creep is told what to do and the creep itself has no purpose and meaning other then the boss is given him. Although in the context of Screeps its cuite difficult cause you get the idea of a observer quite soon.
Al was het maar vanwege het feit hoe je vanuit de 3e persoon de wereld bekijkt en kan besturen.
The System should only define the rules of my creep society and creeps should behave accordingly

# Why

You could wander why this non standard approach? First I would like to create something diffrerent and non standard in an idle hope to beat everyone with a new approach. second I was inspired by the imunology book how our own system works, if evolutiion has created a system which has brought us this far dthere should be some underlying principles which could be valuable also within another domain
