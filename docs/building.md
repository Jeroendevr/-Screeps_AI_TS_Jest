# Building documentation

The order on which the building of construction sites is limited.

As there are multiple classes possible for building. First attempt is to pass the wanted sites to the comms and let the builders request sites if they cant find or work on one.

## Construction Manager

Responsible for structures

## Infrastructure Manager

Responsible for roads

Builder wants to work but cant find a construction site within its room. Ask through the comms for a construction site. Who should be responsible for creating the structure as it could be the construction manager or infra structure manager. As we have no way what a good outcome is, we just build one whichever manager runs first

# TODO implement reading from global comms to place a new construction site.
